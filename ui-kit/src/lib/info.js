/*
 * Info: what the control under the pointer or the keyboard does, in the hint bar.
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Torben Gräber. MIT.
 *
 * AN ELEMENT DECLARES ITS STRING ONCE, as `data-info` -- the kit's controls take
 * it as an `info` prop, anything else spreads `infoAttrs(text)` -- and the
 * window does the rest: one set of listeners on the window's root finds the
 * nearest `[data-info]` above whatever the pointer is over or the keyboard is
 * on, and the hint bar shows it in place of the window's conventions. The same
 * string is the element's `aria-description`, so a screen reader hears what a
 * sighted user reads.
 *
 * WHAT THE BAR SHOWS, IN ORDER OF PRECEDENCE (hintClauses):
 *
 *   1. an action's outcome ("Copied slot 1."), while the editor shows one --
 *      the user just asked for it, and it lasts seconds;
 *   2. the info under the pointer, else the info on the keyboard focus -- the
 *      pointer is the more recent intent, and when it leaves, a focused
 *      control's string is still true;
 *   3. the window's conventions.
 *
 * IN AT ONCE, OUT AFTER A BEAT. A string replaces the bar the moment the
 * pointer arrives; on leaving, the bar waits INFO_DELAY_MS before it goes back,
 * and an arrival inside that wait cancels it -- so a pointer moving along a row
 * of knobs, across the gaps between them, goes from string to string and never
 * flashes the conventions in between.
 *
 * KEYBOARD FOCUS COUNTS ONLY WHEN IT IS VISIBLE (`:focus-visible`). A click
 * focuses a knob too, and a string that stayed after the pointer had gone,
 * because of a click nobody thinks of as focusing, would be a stuck bar.
 *
 * Plain text throughout: the strings are set as text nodes and attribute
 * values, never parsed as markup.
