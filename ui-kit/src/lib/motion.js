/*
 * The Motion switch's state, remembered per editor.
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Torben Gräber. MIT.
 *
 * The design system requires a Motion switch in every window that has a Ground,
 * and a switch a person has to find again every time they open the editor is not
 * really a setting. This is the one place that remembering happens, so that four
 * editors do not each write their own slightly different version of it.
 *
 * IT IS NOT A HOST PARAMETER, and that is the interesting decision rather than
 * an oversight. NI Spectrogram's header states the rule this repository follows:
 * "a number a host should own belongs in the parameter set ... A receiver's VIEW
 * is not: nobody automates which picture they are looking at." Whether the
 * background animates is a view. Making it a parameter would put it in the
 * preset, in the host's automation lanes and in every plugin's state
 * compatibility -- so that a session saved with the background off would turn it
 * off on a different machine, for a different person, who had not asked.
 *
 * SO IT IS PER-MACHINE, PER-EDITOR, AND localStorage. Which brings the caveat
 * below, and it is a real one rather than defensive boilerplate.
 *
 * A WebView on a custom URL scheme is not an ordinary web origin. Depending on
 * the host and the platform, `localStorage` may throw on access, may be
 * partitioned per plugin instance, or may not persist past the editor closing.
 * Every path here therefore has to work when storage is absent, and the default
 * when it is absent is ON -- the design's ground is part of the design, and a
 * window that silently lost it would look broken rather than configured.
