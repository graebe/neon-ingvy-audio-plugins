/*
 * Detents: values a control holds on while it is dragged past them.
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Torben Gräber. MIT.
 *
 * A Length knob at 1/32 has 128 values on 200px of travel, a step and a half
 * of a pixel each, and the four a user is reaching for -- 16, 32, 64, 128 --
 * are as hard to land on as the other 124. A detent makes them easy without
 * making them the only ones.
 *
 * HOW: EVERY DETENT IS GIVEN A STRETCH OF TRAVEL OF ITS OWN. The drag is
 * measured along a "travel" axis that is the value axis with a flat run of
 * DETENT_HOLD_PX inserted at each detent; over that run the value IS the
 * detent. So a drag passing through holds there for the same distance from
 * either side, and nowhere else is the knob any slower than it was. A drag
 * that starts on a detent starts in the middle of its run: half the hold to
 * leave it, either way.
 *
 * It is a pure function of where the press was and how far the pointer has
 * moved since -- no state, no timers -- so a drag back over the same pixels
 * gives the same values, and these functions are the whole of it.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT: the value. Detents are a feel in the editor only; the
 * parameter, its automation and its host stay exactly as continuous or as
 * stepped as they were.
 *
 * Values are whatever unit the caller uses -- normalised 0..1 for a Knob, a
 * count for a Ring -- as long as the detents are in the same one.
 */

/*
 * 14px OF TRAVEL PER DETENT. Under 12 a drag at a normal speed crosses it in a
 * single pointer event and it is not felt; over 16 it is felt as a catch, and
 * at 128 values on 200px it would be the width of ten values. 14px is ~9
 * Length steps' worth of travel, and four detents add 56px to the knob's full
 * sweep, which is still one comfortable drag.
