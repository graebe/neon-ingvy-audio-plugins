 * `transform: scale(k)` on its <main>. The canvas lives inside that <main>, so
 * two measurements of it disagree by exactly k:
 *
 *   clientWidth / clientHeight     layout px, BEFORE the transform (the design's
 *                                  own pixels -- what the field simulates in)
 *   getBoundingClientRect()        viewport px, AFTER it
 *
 * The field's grid is in the first; a panel measured with the second is k times
 * too big and too far from the origin whenever k != 1, and the walls end up
 * somewhere the panels are not. So every rect is divided by k on the way in.
