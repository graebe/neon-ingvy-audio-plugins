 * One drag gesture, tracked on the window.

 * LISTENERS GO ON THE WINDOW, NOT THE ELEMENT, and that is the whole reason
 * this file exists. Both the knob and the pads attached `pointermove` to the
 * element under the cursor, so a drag stopped tracking the moment the pointer
 * left the 48px knob or the 40px pad -- which reads as "it didn't take until
 * I clicked again", because the next press starts a fresh gesture that does
 * work for its first few pixels.
 *
 * `setPointerCapture` is the other half of the same trap: it is fine when it
 * works and silent when it does not. A window listener needs neither.
