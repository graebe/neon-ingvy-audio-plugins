/*
 * The animated ground: a damped wave field on the dot paper.
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Torben Gräber. MIT.
 *
 * A PORT, NOT A DESIGN. Every number and every step here comes from the
 * Ultraviolet design system's own reference implementation,
 * design/files/project/components/ground.js, and the model is spelled out in
 * design/files/project/README.md under Motion. Nothing in this file is a
 * judgement call about how the background should look -- if it reads wrong, the
 * design system is where that gets decided.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES. A trigger makes every panel edge and the window border emit one
 * slow ring. Rings travel through the background only -- panels and wells are
 * solid to them -- reflect off those edges and off the window border, cross each
 * other and interfere, and the whole field rings out over about twenty seconds.
 * On a peak the dots grow and brighten and the grain thickens; in a valley they
 * shrink and dim and it thins. THE GRAIN ITSELF NEVER MOVES, only its local
 * density: moving grain reads as television static.
 *
 * With no trigger the field is exactly zero, the canvas shows the static design --
 * the same dots, the same colours, grain of the same density -- and the render
 * loop STOPS. That last part is not an optimisation, it is the design's rule:
 * "Controls never animate", and a background that idles is a background that is
 * animating. (It is not PIXEL-identical to the CSS fallback underneath: the
 * grain is uniform noise either way, but this tile is drawn fresh with
 * Math.random, as the design's reference does, and the CSS one is the design's
 * fixed PNG. Only the canvas is ever on screen while it works, so no seam shows.)
 *
 * IT ALSO STOPS WHILE NOBODY CAN SEE IT: a hidden document pauses the loop and a
 * visible one resumes it, and prefers-reduced-motion is followed live rather
 * than read once.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT HERE, AND WHY. The reference ships a second half, a BassDetector
 * that builds a Web Audio graph and finds the kick in the browser. Here the
 * ground follows the host's tempo instead, by the owner's decision: a ring on
 * every beat while the song plays, the downbeat strongest
 * (docs/tech/ground.md). The beat is found in Rust on the audio thread
 * (engines/ground) and arrives as a message; `trigger` is where it lands. This
 * is the ONLY part of the reference that moved.
 *
 * NO COLOUR IS SPELLED HERE. The reference carries three RGB triples in its
 * defaults; a canvas cannot use a CSS variable, so this reads them back out of
 * tokens.css through `readRgb` -- the same seam, and for the same reason, as
 * lib/ramp.js. See the note at the top of that file.
