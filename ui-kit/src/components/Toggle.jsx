 * THE SWITCH FORM: a 28x14 bg-200 housing with an 8x8 square at 2px that moves
 * to 16px and lights.
 *
 * The LED form (a round lens) is for state the plugin REPORTS; a user-settable
 * boolean is a switch. Getting it backwards would say the plugin is telling you
 * something when in fact it is asking.
 *
 * A BUTTON, NOT A DIV WITH AN onClick. It was the latter, which cannot be
 * focused or reached from the keyboard at all -- so the focus ring the design
 * system specifies had nowhere to land and `tab` skipped straight over it. A
 * button is the thing this already was; it brings focus, Space and Enter with
 * it and costs a style reset.
