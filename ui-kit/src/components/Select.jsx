/*
 * A choice, not a quantity. Copyright (c) 2026 Torben Gräber. MIT.
 *
 * THE MECHANISM IS THE PART WORTH KEEPING: a styled div with a REAL, invisible
 * <select> stretched over it. The popup is then the OS's -- which is the only
 * kind that behaves correctly inside a plugin's WebView, where a div-based menu
 * would be clipped by the window and would not follow the pointer out of it.
 *
 * The caret is the design set's `chevron` Icon, as the Select card draws it.
 *
 * IT TAKES AN INDEX, NOT A PARAMETER. The Trance Gate's version was bound to a
 * host parameter and converted normalised values in and out; the Spectrogram's
 * fork took an index because it has no parameters to bind to. The index form is
 * the one that belongs in a kit -- a Select is a choice widget, and knowing
 * what a choice MEANS is the caller's business. See ParamSelect in the Trance
 * Gate's editor for the binding.
