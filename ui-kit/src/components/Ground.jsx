/*
 * The window's animated ground.
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Torben Gräber. MIT.
 *
 * THE DESIGN SYSTEM GIVES EVERY WINDOW ONE OF THESE, and it is the only thing in
 * the whole system that animates. `lib/field.js` is the simulation, ported from
 * the design's own reference; this file is the four things a Solid editor has to
 * do around it: own the canvas, keep the field's idea of the window's size and
 * boxes current, pass the Motion switch through, and stop cleanly.
 *
 * WHERE IT GOES. First child of the window element, which in this repository is
 * each editor's `<main>`. It is `position: absolute; inset: 0` with `z-index: 0`,
 * so it fills the window and everything else paints over it -- see the `.ground`
 * rule in components.css, and the note there about the one thing each editor's
 * app.css has to provide.
 *
 * THE SOURCES ARE MEASURED FROM THE DOM, not declared. The design says the boxes
 * that emit and reflect are the panels, grids, wells and rings the window
 * happens to contain, so asking the document is the statement that stays true
 * when a layout changes. A selector list is overridable because the editors do
 * not agree on class names -- the Spectrogram's picture is a `.spectro`, the
 * Side-Chain's is a `.plot` -- and a box the field should respect but that
 * matches nothing gets `data-wave-source`.
 *
 * WHY A ResizeObserver AND NOT A WINDOW RESIZE LISTENER. Two of these editors
 * resize themselves from the UI (the Trance Gate grows with its rows, the
 * Side-Chain with its shaper) by telling the plugin to resize the host window.
 * That changes `main`'s box without necessarily firing a window resize the
 * canvas would see in the right order, and a field whose grid disagrees with its
 * canvas draws the ground at the wrong pitch. Observing the element asks about
 * the thing that actually matters.
 *
 * AND WHY THAT IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN. Every editor here also scales its
 * <main> with a CSS transform to fit the viewport, and a transform is not a
 * resize: the ResizeObserver never hears about it. So the element's `style` is
 * watched as well (that is where each editor writes its scale), and the window's
 * resize, which is how a devicePixelRatio or zoom change arrives. All of it is
 * coalesced into one re-measure per frame.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO: idle. There is no animation loop running when nothing has
 * happened -- `Field` stops its own loop once the field is at rest (and while
 * the document is hidden), and at rest the canvas shows the static design.
