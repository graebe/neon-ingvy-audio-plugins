/*
 * Three clauses at most. Truncating rather than shrinking the text is
 * deliberate: a fourth clause means the window needs simplifying, not a smaller
 * font.
 *
 * THE SIGNATURE CLOSES THE BAR, which is Ultraviolet 1.0.0's rule: it belongs
 * to the WINDOW ("exactly once, at the right end of the Hint bar"), not to any
 * one editor's layout. Carrying it here is what makes that structural -- an
 * editor cannot forget it, put it elsewhere, or show two.
 *
 * AND THE MOTION SWITCH RIDES HERE FOR EXACTLY THE SAME REASON. The design
 * system lists "use it in a window without a Motion switch" under Ground's
 * Don'ts, so the switch is a property of a window that has a ground rather than
 * of any editor's layout. An editor passes `motion` and `onMotion`; one that
 * passes neither has no ground and gets no switch. Putting it here is what makes
 * "every window with a Ground has one" true by construction instead of by
 * four editors each remembering.
 *
 * WHAT THE CLAUSES SAY IS DECIDED ABOVE THIS: EditorFrame passes the window's
 * conventions, an action's outcome or the string of the control under the
 * pointer (lib/info.js, hintClauses). The bar only draws them -- as text, so a
 * string can never be markup.

        * signature do not fit in the 296 that leaves, and unwrapped spans in a

        * least still a readable tip.

        * -- the ellipsis is the signal, not the fix.
