/*
 * A knob that can be dragged finely, and its readout.
 * Copyright (c) 2026 Torben Gräber. MIT.
 *
 * Ported from UvLookAndFeel::drawRotarySlider and UvReadout::paint.
 *
 * From the Knob card, a 48px box: disc r 16, rail r 20, pointer r 6 -> 14,
 * 2px stroke. Expressed as fractions of 48 because knob-lg is the same
 * drawing at 64. The rail runs 270 degrees with the gap at the bottom.
 *
 * IT KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT PARAMETERS. It was wired straight to setParam and the
 * gesture calls; in the kit it takes `value` (normalised 0..1) and reports
 * through onInput / onBegin / onEnd, because a knob is a way of turning a
 * number and what that number MEANS is the caller's business. The same rule the
 * Select follows -- see ParamKnob in the Trance Gate's editor for the binding.
 *
 * `display` is the text under it, which the PLUGIN formats: this side holds no
 * units, no precision and no enum labels, by design, so it could not format one
 * if it wanted to.
 *
 * `detents` (normalised, optional) are values a drag holds on -- see
 * lib/detents.js for the feel and its numbers. Page Up and Page Down go to the
 * next one, and each is drawn as a tick outside the rail: an `ink-dim` mark,
 * as the system's inactive marks are, and `uv` while the value is on it.
 * Typed text, the reset and the arrows are untouched by them.
